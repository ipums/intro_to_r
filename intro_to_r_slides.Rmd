### Statistical Software Package

knitr::include_graphics("images/stata-logo.png")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "SPSS logo"}

### Programming Language
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "Python logo"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/python-logo.png")
```

]

???
Like statistical software packages, such as Stata, SPSS, and SAS, R has built-in
functionality for statistical analysis.

Like programming languages, such as Python, R is designed to facilitate the 
creation of user-contributed functions and packages to perform a variety of 
computing tasks, including data management, exploration, analysis, and 
reporting.

---

# Introduction - What is R?


### Statistical Software Package + Programming Language

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "R logo"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-logo.svg")
```


???
In other words, R combines the statistical capabilities of a stats package with 
the flexibility of a more general purpose programming language.

One example of R's flexibility: The slides we're looking at right now were
created using R!

---

# Point-and-click vs. Code  

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.alt = "Brief screen recording of a mouse pointer clicking through the menu interface in Stata"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stata-menu-interface.gif")
```

???
Because R is a stats package *and* a programming language, the experience of 
learning R is a bit different from other stats packages.

Whereas some other stats packages like Stata and SPSS offer a point-and-click 
menu interface for common operations...


---

# Point-and-click vs. Code

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "Brief screen recording of typing the command `table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)` into the RStudio console and printing a crosstabulation of those two variables."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-table-screen-recording.gif")
```


???
Learning R typically involves learning to write R code from the very beginning. 

This contributes to a slightly steeper initial learning curve for R compared to 
other stats packages, but the medium- and long-term benefits of managing and 
analyzing your data with code far outweigh this short term cost.


---

# Why use R?

--

* Flexibility

--

* Cutting-edge and trustworthy statistical methods

--

* Open source

--

* Large, active, friendly user community

--

* Free!



???
That leads us right into our next question: Why do we think you should use R?

First, because R is a fully-realized programming language, it provides 
flexibility to complete a variety of tasks, including but not limited to data 
management, analysis, visualization, and reporting. Thus, the initial 
investment in learning R has a big payoff in potential use cases.

Secondly, R is the language of choice for most academic statisticians, so new 
statistical techniques are often available in R before they come to other stats 
packages. For example, and particularly relevant in the context of census data, 
many leading researchers in statistical disclosure control create R packages to 
implement their techniques.

Because of this close connection with academic statistics, you can also trust 
the soundness of the statistical techniques implemented in R. Often, researchers 
will publish descriptions of new packages in the peer-reviewed Journal of 
Statistical Software. 

Moreover, both R and contributed R packages are open source, and most functions
in R are written in ordinary R code, so the community of R users can review the
implementation of particular techniques, fix bugs and errors, or adapt code for 
new purposes.

Speaking of the community, R has a large, active, and friendly user community 
that is constantly working to improve R and creating resources for learning R.

Finally, in contrast to most other stats packages, R is free!

Here we can (probably) see our data has been read in and printed...probably not what most users want/need.

# Key Terms - Functions, **Objects**, Packages

--

Technically the **output** of `read.csv()` is a `data.frame`
--

  + A `data.frame` is like a spreadsheet
  + Data organized into rows and columns

--

We must **assign** the **output** of `read.csv()` to an **R Object** in order to work with it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
 my_data <- read.csv(file = "example_data.csv")

To create an **R object**, use the **`<-`** command.

We recommend installing both R and RStudio. The distinction between these two 
can be confusing at first, but one way to think of it is that R is the engine, 
and RStudio is the fancy sports car powered by the engine.

In other words, you need R to use RStudio, and RStudio makes it easier and more 
fun to use R

# Reusable Code: R Scripts

One of the benefits of doing your data cleaning and analysis using code is 
that you can document what you did, and you can reuse and adapt your code for 
future work.

One way to save your code to make it reusable is to put it in what we call an 
R "script", which is just a plain text file with a ".R" file extension.

R scripts are great for data cleaning and other tasks where you're not focused 
on communicating your results, but they do have some limitations. First, you 
can only provide context and explanation of your code through the use of 
comments, which are the green lines we see here that start with one or more 
hashtag symbols, and there is no support for formatted text such as bold or 
italics. Second, running an R script does not by default create a save-able 
output file that weaves together your code, explanatory text, and output 
objects, such as tables and graphs. Thus, if you wanted to create a report from 
an R script, you might end up saving tables and graphs out to their own files, 
then copying and pasting those into something like a Microsoft Word document. 
That's where R Markdown documents come in.

# Reusable Code + Reporting: R Markdown

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt="screenshot of r markdown file, code is more distinct, more formatting apparent", out.width = "95%"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/rmarkdown_cropped.png")
```

???
R Markdown documents, such as the one shown in the screenshot here, are also 
just plain text files, but with a .Rmd file extension instead of .R. However, 
R Markdown documents use a special syntax that allows you to weave together
formatted explanatory text and code chunks, and most importantly, R Markdown 
documents can be rendered to produce HTML, PDF, or Microsoft Word reports that 
included formatted text, R code, and code output, including tables and graphs.

# Reusable Code: R Script vs. R Markdown

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt="screenshot of example script, code and comments are hard to differentiate" }

knitr::include_graphics("images/rscript_cropped.png")
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt="screenshot of r markdown file, code is more distinct, more formatting apparent"}

knitr::include_graphics("images/rmarkdown_cropped.png")
```
]

???
So, as I said, both R scripts and R Markdown documents are a great way to save 
your code to document it and make it reusable, and both are ultimately just
plain text files, as we see here with the R script on the left and the R 
Markdown document on the right. Using R Markdown requires learning a little bit 
of additional syntax, but there is a lot of documentation out there to help you 
learn it, and the payoff...

# Reusable Code: R Markdown Report


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt="screenshot of rendered html report showing table of contents, headings, and stylized code/plain text narration", out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rmd_render_with_graph.png")
```

???
Is that you can create beautiful, reproducible reports like the HTML report we 
see here. Here we see a hyperlinked table of contents to navigate our document, 
a formatted heading and explanatory text, an R code chunk, and the graph 
produced by that R code. 

If we had created this report by pasting tables and graphs into Microsoft Word,
and then we realized we wanted to make a change, we would have to rerun our code
and manually copy and paste the results back into our document. With R Markdown,
making a change to the report is as easy as changing your code and clicking a
button to re-render the report.

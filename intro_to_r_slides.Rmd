### Statistical Software Package

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "SPSS logo"}

]

???
Like statistical software packages, such as Stata, SPSS, and SAS, R has built-in
functionality for statistical analysis.

Like programming languages, such as Python, R is designed to facilitate the 
creation of user-contributed functions and packages to perform a variety of 
computing tasks, including data management, exploration, analysis, and 
reporting.

# What is R?


### Statistical Software Package + Programming Language

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "R logo"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-logo.svg")
```


???
In other words, R combines the statistical capabilities of a stats package with 
the flexibility of a more general purpose programming language.

One example of R's flexibility: The slides we're looking at right now were
created using R!

---

# Point-and-click vs. Code  

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.alt = "Brief screen recording of a mouse pointer clicking through the menu interface in Stata"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stata-menu-interface.gif")
```

???
Because R is a stats package *and* a programming language, the experience of 
learning R is a bit different from other stats packages.

Whereas some other stats packages like Stata and SPSS offer a point-and-click 
menu interface for common operations...


---

# Point-and-click vs. Code

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", fig.alt = "Brief screen recording of typing the command `table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)` into the RStudio console and printing a crosstabulation of those two variables."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-table-screen-recording.gif")
```


???
Learning R typically involves learning to write R code from the very beginning. 

This contributes to a slightly steeper initial learning curve for R compared to 
other stats packages, but the medium- and long-term benefits of managing and 
analyzing your data with code far outweigh this short term cost.


---

# Why use R?

--

* Flexibility

--

* Cutting-edge and trustworthy statistical methods

--

* Open source

--

* Large, active, friendly user community

--

* Free!



???
That leads us right into our next question: Why do we think you should use R?

First, because R is a fully-realized programming language, it provides 
flexibility to complete a variety of tasks, including but not limited to data 
management, analysis, visualization, and reporting. Thus, the initial 
investment in learning R has a big payoff in potential use cases.

Secondly, R is the language of choice for most academic statisticians, so new 
statistical techniques are often available in R before they come to other stats 
packages. For example, and particularly relevant in the context of census data, 
many leading researchers in statistical disclosure control create R packages to 
implement their techniques.

Because of this close connection with academic statistics, you can also trust 
the soundness of the statistical techniques implemented in R. Often, researchers 
will publish descriptions of new packages in the peer-reviewed Journal of 
Statistical Software. 

Moreover, both R and contributed R packages are open source, and most functions
in R are written in ordinary R code, so the community of R users can review the
implementation of particular techniques, fix bugs and errors, or adapt code for 
new purposes.

Speaking of the community, R has a large, active, and friendly user community 
that is constantly working to improve R and creating resources for learning R.

Finally, in contrast to most other stats packages, R is free!

Here we can (probably) see our data has been read in and printed...probably not what most users want/need.

# Key Terms - Functions, **Objects**, Packages

--

Technically the **output** of `read.csv()` is a `data.frame`
--

  + A `data.frame` is like a spreadsheet
  + Data organized into rows and columns

--

We must **assign** the **output** of `read.csv()` to an **R Object** in order to work with it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
 my_data <- read.csv(file = "example_data.csv")

```


**R objects** 
  * Variables, data, or anything else stored in R's local memory, or **environment**,
  * Can be interacted with via **functions**

To create an **R object**, use the `<-` command.

  * `<-` is called the **assignment operator**
  * Can be thought of as "gets" or "gets the result of"
  * "*my_data gets the result of read.csv*"

---


# Key Terms - Functions, **Objects**, Packages

Now that `my_data` is stored as an **R object**, we can use **functions** to interact with it.

We recommend installing both R and RStudio. The distinction between these two 
can be confusing at first, but one way to think of it is that R is the engine, 
and RStudio is the fancy sports car powered by the engine.

In other words, you need R to use RStudio, and RStudio makes it easier and more 
fun to use R

# What is R ???

A language and environment for statistical computing

Effectively: R is a stats package, like stata/spss/sas

# Why use R ???

* free and open-source
* data management/manipulation/visualization all in 1 program
* IPUMS and many other organizations already use R for census/survey data - Large community support!

--

* endlessly customizable

R vs Rstudio

--

- R is the engine, Rstudio is the car

- Rstudio is a GUI that makes it easier to interact with R

???

Any R users currently - raise hands
Rstudio facilitates work in R by creating **Rprojects**
varying scopes of projects - user decision, we use a separate project for each country


---

# rework into previous


Clicks vs Code

--

- Many stats/spreadsheet software are specialized to perform  a relatively small amount of common statistical functions. These programs tend to provide user-friendly buttons and drop down menus allowing users to **click around** in order to achieve their goals.
  + These programs make MANY assumptions about what input data might look like and limit the options a user has to click from.


--

- R is a **programming language**. Rather than clicking buttons, users must write, or **code**, the operations they want to perform. 
  + More of a learning curve than other programs
  + R makes virtually no assumptions about the input data or steps of a script
  + Can use R for data management, including meta-data, and analysis
  + *maybe reference IPUMS/ IPUMS metadata*
    + use IPUMSR as a case study of how greg expanded functionality to easily read/write our unique structured data

# Key terms/Concepts


**Functions**, Objects, Packages

To read data into R, we use the `read.csv()` **function**.

* **Functions** end in parentheses
* **Functions** take various **arguments** within their parentheses * **Functions** perform actions/operations

* **Functions** take `inputs` and return `outputs`.

  Here the input is the filepath, `"example_data.csv"` specified as the `file=`  **argument** of the `read.csv` **function**. 

.pull-left[

User Input:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

read.csv(file="example_data.csv")
```
]

.pull-right[

R output:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
read.csv("example_data.csv")
```

]

???

Here we can (probably) see our data has been read in and printed...probably not what most users want/need.

---


# Key terms/Concepts


Functions, **Objects**, Packages


Technically, `read.csv()` returns a `data.frame`
  + `data.frame`s are like spreadsheets, with data organized into rows and columns.
  
Instead of printing the contents of `"example_data.csv"`, we want save that information to an **R object**. 

**R objects** are variables, data, (even functions) stored in R's local memory so the user can interact with them. 

To create an **R object**, use the `<-` command to **assign** the contents of `"example_data.csv"` to an **R object** called `my_data`. 
  + `<-` is called the **assignment operator** and can be read as "gets" or "gets the result of"
  + The below code could be read as: *"my_data gets the result of read.csv"

---


# Key terms/Concepts


Functions, **Objects**, Packages

Now that `my_data` is stored as an **R object**, we can use **functions** to interact with it.
  * To type the assignment operator, use `[less than]``[minus sign]`


.pull-left[

User Input:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

my_data <- read.csv("example_data.csv")
# View(my_data)
```

]

.pull-right[

R output:
```{r, echo= FALSE}
my_data <- read.csv("example_data.csv")
# View(my_data)
```

]


???

"everything in R is an object, everything you do in R is a function" - someone, somewhere, probably

---



# Key terms/Concepts

Some functions work on `matrices` or `data.tables`, while others are meant for single columns or `vectors`.

Data **Objects** with named elements (like columns) can be accessed using `$`

.pull-left[

User Input:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
nrow(my_data)
ncol(my_data)
colnames(my_data)

mean(my_data$AGE)
summary(my_data$AGE)
```

]

.pull-right[

R output:
```{r, echo= FALSE}

nrow(my_data)
ncol(my_data)
colnames(my_data)

mean(my_data$AGE)
summary(my_data$AGE)
```

]


---


# Key terms/Concepts


Functions, Objects, **Packages**

**Packages** are bundles of In R, collections of **functions** can be bundled into **package**.

**base R** refers to the "starter set" of packages users get when they "download R".

--

Using **base R** users *could* write code to accomplish *nearly* anything they want to...but it might take time

--

The **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN) hosts > 18k Contributed Packages that expand the capabilities of R.
  + Add support for specific/obscure programs or file types
  + Streamline common tasks, data wrangling/visualization
  + Bundle complex analysis/operations into simple, user friendly functions


???

3 main "avenues" for packages

While openxlsx is geared towards interacting with a specific filetype, other packages streamline common operations or execute specific analysis - all serve to expand the functioanlit of R

---

# Key terms/Concepts

Functions, Objects, **Packages**

While base R does not have support to read .xlsx files, we can get the `openxlsx` package like so:


```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("openxlsx") ## download from CRAN

library(openxlsx) ## load package locally

my_data <- read.xlsx("example_data.xlsx")

write.xlsx(my_data, "example_data.xlsx")

```


* `install.packages()` needs to be done only once - or periodically to update. 
* `library()` needs to called each time you open R (to access that package)

---

# Key terms/Concepts

Functions, Objects, **Packages**


.pull-left[
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("gtsummary") ## download from CRAN
install.packages("ggplot2") 

library(ggplot2)  ## load package locally
library(ggplot2)

```
]

.pull-right[

Streamlining common tasks / quality of life packages 
  * `gtsummary` Makes it easy to render informative and polished tables.
  * `ggplot2` Makes data visualization easier. 
  * More on this in the demo

# Key terms/Concepts


Functions, Objects, **Packages**

**don't focus on broader applicability**
**do mention it as a plug**
**and specifically how 

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("ipumsr") ## download from CRAN

library(ipumsr) ## load package locally

```

]

.pull-right[
Adding support for complex operations - `ipumsr`
  * Functions to support working with complex data
    + numeric microdata with associated value labels
    + complex household/person structure
    + structured metadata
  * Functions to support working with BIG DATA
  * Functions to access ipums microdata API from R/Rstudio
    + submit, check on, and download data extracts
]

User Input:



--

**Don't be intimidated!**

* Packages provide high level of *customization*
* Data management, Analysis, Visualization, Reporting all in one program
* See [Resource List]() for our recommendations of common/helpful R packages for working with census/survey data.

  + simple built in functions - what is a function
    + mean of vector
    + 1:5 sequence
    + c()
    + vectors vs matrices vs data.frames
      + data.frame ~ dataset
    + built in R datasets
    
    
  + reference this as analagous to a "do-file" in spss
  + same code
  + creating scripts/processes
- loading packages 
- explain packages
- explain base r vs tidyverse
  + consistent syntax
  + data.frame centric - takes some of the confusion out of using R

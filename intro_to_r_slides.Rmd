# 1. Introduction


---
# What is R ???

A language and environment for statistical computing

Effectively: R is a stats package, like stata/spss/sas

---
# Why use R ???

* free and open-source
* data management/manipulation/visualization all in 1 program
* IPUMS and many other organizations already use R for census/survey data - Large community support!

--

* endlessly customizable

R vs Rstudio

--

- R is the engine, Rstudio is the car

- Rstudio is a GUI that makes it easier to interact with R

???

Any R users currently - raise hands
Rstudio facilitates work in R by creating **Rprojects**
varying scopes of projects - user decision, we use a separate project for each country


---

# rework into previous


Clicks vs Code

--

- Many stats/spreadsheet software are specialized to perform  a relatively small amount of common statistical functions. These programs tend to provide user-friendly buttons and drop down menus allowing users to **click around** in order to achieve their goals.
  + These programs make MANY assumptions about what input data might look like and limit the options a user has to click from.


--

- R is a **programming language**. Rather than clicking buttons, users must write, or **code**, the operations they want to perform. 
  + More of a learning curve than other programs
  + R makes virtually no assumptions about the input data or steps of a script
  + Can use R for data management, including meta-data, and analysis
  + *maybe reference IPUMS/ IPUMS metadata*
    + use IPUMSR as a case study of how greg expanded functionality to easily read/write our unique structured data



---
# Key Terms - **Functions**, Objects, Packages

To read data into R, we can use the `read.csv()` **function**.
* **Functions** end in parentheses
* **Functions** take various **arguments** within their parentheses as **input**.
* **Functions** perform actions/operations on the inputs and usually return **output**.
--


The `read.csv()` **function** takes the `file=`  **argument** as **input**. Below, we *pass* the filepath `"example_data.csv"`as the **argument** to the **function** 

.pull-left[
User Input:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

read.csv(file="example_data.csv")
```
]

.pull-right[
R output:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
read.csv("example_data.csv")
knitr::include_graphics("images/print_csv_1.png")
```


`...`


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/print_csv_2.png")
```
]

 

???

Here we can (probably) see our data has been read in and printed...probably not what most users want/need.

---


# Key Terms


Functions, **Objects**, Packages


Technically the **output** of `read.csv()` is a `data.frame`
  + `data.frame`s are like spreadsheets, with data organized into rows and columns.
  
Instead of printing the contents of `"example_data.csv"`, we want save that information to an **R object**. 

**R objects** are variables, data, (even functions) stored in R's local memory so the user can interact with them. 

To create an **R object**, use the `<-` command to **assign** the contents of `"example_data.csv"` to an **R object** called `my_data`. 
  + `<-` is called the **assignment operator** and can be read as "gets" or "gets the result of"
  + The below code could be read as: *"my_data gets the result of read.csv"

---


# Key Terms


Functions, **Objects**, Packages

Now that `my_data` is stored as an **R object**, we can use **functions** to interact with it.
  * To type the assignment operator, use `[less than]``[minus sign]`
  * In some cases, like when only one argument is needed, the argument name does not need to be specified


.pull-left[

User Input:
```{r, eval = FALSE}

my_data <- read.csv(file = "example_data.csv")
View(my_data)
```

]

.pull-right[

R output:
```{r, echo= FALSE}
my_data <- read.csv("example_data.csv")
knitr::include_graphics("images/view_data.png")
```

]


???

"everything in R is an object, everything you do in R is a function" - someone, somewhere, probably

---



# Key Terms

The **output** of `read.csv()` is a `data.frame`.
  + Like a spreadsheet, `data.frames` organize data by rows and columns.

Some functions work `data.tables`, while others are meant for single columns or `vectors`.
  + Specify a column name using `$`

.pull-left[

User Input:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
nrow(my_data)
ncol(my_data)
colnames(my_data)

mean(my_data$AGE)
summary(my_data$AGE)
```

]

.pull-right[

R output:
```{r, echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/functions_on_objects.png")
```

]

# Key Terms


Functions, Objects, **Packages**

**Packages** are bundles of In R, collections of **functions** can be bundled into **package**.

**base R** refers to the "starter set" of packages users get when they "download R".

  + Using **base R** users *could* write code to accomplish *nearly* anything they want to
--
  + Takes time and effort to code
  + *Can't someone else do it??*

---

Functions, Objects, **Packages**

The **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork (CRAN) hosts > 18k Contributed Packages that expand the capabilities of R.
  + Add support for specific/obscure programs or file types
  + Streamline common tasks, data wrangling/visualization
  + Bundle complex analysis/operations into simple, user friendly functions

--

**Don't be intimidated!**

* Packages provide high level of *customization*, allowing the user to fine-tune thier R experience
* Data management, Analysis, Visualization, Reporting all in one program
* See [Resource List]() for our recommendations of common/helpful R packages for working with census/survey data.

3 main "avenues" for packages

While openxlsx is geared towards interacting with a specific filetype, other packages streamline common operations or execute specific analysis - all serve to expand the functioanlit of R

---

# Key Terms

Functions, Objects, **Packages**

While base R does not have support to read .xlsx files, `openxlsx` provides read/write support.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("openxlsx") ## download from CRAN
library(openxlsx) ## load package locally

my_data <- read.xlsx("example_data.xlsx")
write.xlsx(my_data,file =  "example_data.xlsx")

install.packages("haven")
librarry(haven)

my_data <- haven::read_dta(file = "example_data.dta") ## STATA




```


* `install.packages()` needs to be done only once - or periodically to update. 
* `library()` needs to called each time you open R (to access that package)

??

Example of a package that interacts with a specific program

---

Functions, Objects, **Packages**

For interacting with other stats packages (eg, STATA, SPSS, SAS), we reccomend the `haven` package.

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("haven")
library(haven)

read_stata()
read_dta()

read_sas()
read_xpt()

read_spss()
read_por()
read_sav()
```
]
.pull-right[
In addition to supporting many filetypes, `haven` supports labeled values
  + More on this in the demo

# Key Terms

Functions, Objects, **Packages**


.pull-left[
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("gtsummary") ## download from CRAN
install.packages("ggplot2") 

library(gtsummary)  ## load package locally
library(ggplot2)

```
]

.pull-right[

Streamlining common tasks / quality of life packages 
  * `gtsummary` Makes it easy to render informative and polished tables.
  * `ggplot2` Makes data visualization easier. 
  * More on this in the demo
]

# Key Terms


Functions, Objects, **Packages**

Adding support for complex operations - `ipumsr`

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("ipumsr") ## download from CRAN

library(ipumsr) ## load package locally

```

]

.pull-right[
  * Developed in-house functions for working with extensive metadata
    + Took advantage of structured and standardized data
    + DDI standard, plus IPUMS-specific fields
  * Released on CRAN in **2013???** for IPUMS users to benefit
    + **Newly added** API support for the IPUMS microdata extract system.

How do I get it?!?

???

now that you've learned some fundamentals, we'll go over:
* installation R/Rstudio
* basic setup and navigation.
* Review Key Terms in action

---


# Installation - R

https://cran.r-project.org/

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A screenshot of download links on cran.r-project.org"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r_install_1.png")
```

  
+ https://cran.r-project.orgbin/windows/base/
+ https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
+ (pre-bundled on linux)


???

Don't go too quickly on this

---

# Installation - Rstudio


https://www.rstudio.com/

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.alt = "A screenshot of download links on cran.r-project.org"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio_install2.png")
```

# Demo: Rstudio Navigation


???


- environment setup
- basic "pane" navigation
  + enter basic code in console
    + r as a calculator
    + basic mathematic operators/forumals
    
  + simple built in functions - what is a function
    + mean of vector
    + 1:5 sequence
    + c()
    + vectors vs matrices vs data.frames
      + data.frame ~ dataset
    + built in R datasets
    
    
  + reference this as analagous to a "do-file" in stata and "syntax file" in spss
  + same code
  + creating scripts/processes
- loading packages 
- explain packages
- explain base r vs tidyverse
  + consistent syntax
  + data.frame centric - takes some of the confusion out of using R

# NOTES 

Can you highlight the "<-" command so it stands out that it is the command

Maybe animate and bring in line by line as you discuss? (since it's a lot of text) animate some, cut down,

Can you highlight or enlarge the symbol (etc.) that you are defining?
